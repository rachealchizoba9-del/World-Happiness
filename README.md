# 🌍 World Happiness Dashboard 

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases an interactive *World Happiness Dashboard* built using *Power BI* to analyze global happiness trends across countries. The dashboard focuses on key social, economic, and health indicators that contribute to overall happiness levels worldwide.

The aim of this project is to transform complex data from the World Happiness Report into clear, visual insights that support data-driven understanding and comparison.

## 🔍 Insights from the Dashboard

### 🌐 Global Coverage
- The analysis includes data from *169 countries*, providing a broad global perspective.
- This allows for meaningful comparison of happiness indicators across regions and income levels.

### 😊 Happiness Score & Ranking
- Countries are evaluated using happiness scores and global rankings.
- Higher-ranking countries often show strong performance across multiple contributing factors rather than just one metric.

### 🧬 Healthy Life Expectancy
- Healthy life expectancy has a strong relationship with happiness levels.
- Countries with better health outcomes tend to record higher happiness scores.

### 🤝 Social Support Over Time
- The *Social Support by Year* trend highlights how community and support systems evolve.
- An upward trend in recent years suggests improving social connections in many regions.

### 🎁 Generosity Trends
- Generosity varies across years, showing periods of stability and decline.
- While generosity alone does not determine happiness, it complements social support in improving well-being.

### 💰 GDP per Capita
- Economic strength plays an important role in happiness outcomes.
- Countries with higher GDP per capita generally score higher, though wealth alone does not guarantee happiness.

### ⚖ Confidence Intervals
- Upper and lower confidence intervals provide insight into score reliability and variation across countries.
- This helps in understanding uncertainty and distribution in happiness measurements.
